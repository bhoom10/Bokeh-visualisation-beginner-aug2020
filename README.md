## Setup
All the required dependencies are specified in the file *requirements.txt*. 
It is easy to create a Python 3 (ana)conda environment named `bokeh_env` and install all the dependencies with the following command:
```conda create --name bokeh_env --file requirements.txt python=3.7```

Then, activate this environment with the command:
```conda activate bokeh_env```

Alternatively, you can install all the dependencies using pip with the following command:
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

**Note:** Please ensure that you navigate to the directory where the *requirements.txt* file is stored before running either of these commands
